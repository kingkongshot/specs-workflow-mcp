An intelligent MCP server that guides AI to create software project specifications through a structured workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks.

## Quick Start - How to Use

After installation, simply tell your AI assistant:

### Start a New Project
```
"Help me use specs to create a user authentication system"
```
or
```
"Use specs to organize our chat history into project documentation"
```

The AI will:
1. 📝 Create a requirements document based on user stories
2. 🎨 Generate a design document with technical details
3. ✅ List clear implementation tasks
4. 🚀 Guide development following the task list

### Continue Existing Project
```
"Use specs to check ./my-project"
```

The AI will pick up where you left off and continue the workflow.

### How It Works

1. **You describe what you want** - Just explain your project idea
2. **AI creates structured docs** - Requirements → Design → Tasks
3. **You review and approve** - Each stage needs your confirmation
4. **Development follows tasks** - Clear, trackable implementation

Each step requires your approval before proceeding, ensuring you maintain control over the project direction.

## Installation

```

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Add to your Cursor configuration (`~/.cursor/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cline

Use Cline's MCP server management UI to add the server:

1. Open VS Code with Cline extension
2. Open Cline settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to MCP Servers section
4. Add new server with:
   - Command: `npx`
   - Arguments: `-y spec-workflow-mcp@latest`

#### Windsurf (Codeium)

Add to your Windsurf configuration (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {},
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code (with MCP extension)

Add to your VS Code settings (`settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Zed

Add to your Zed configuration (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "version": "2",
    "mcp": {
      "servers": {
        "spec-workflow": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingkongshot/specs-mcp.git
cd specs-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then add to Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/specs-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflow

<details>
<summary>📋 See Complete Example</summary>

### 1. Start with an idea
```
You: "I need to build a user authentication system"
```

### 2. AI creates requirements
```
AI: "I'll help you create specs for user authentication. Let me start with the requirements document..."

[Creates requirements.md with user stories, functional requirements, etc.]

AI: "I've created the requirements document. Please review it and let me know if you'd like any changes."
```

### 3. Review and confirm
```
You: "Looks good, continue"
```

### 4. AI creates design
```
AI: "Now I'll create the technical design based on these requirements..."

[Creates design.md with architecture, API design, database schema, etc.]
```

### 5. AI creates tasks
```
AI: "Based on the design, here are the implementation tasks..."

[Creates tasks.md with numbered task list]
```

### 6. Start development
```
AI: "Let's start with Task 1: Set up authentication database schema..."

[Implements each task in order]
```

## Key Features

- 📝 **User Story Based**: Start with user stories and transform them into technical requirements
- 🔄 **Three-Phase Workflow**: Requirements → Design → Tasks with progress tracking
- ✅ **Task Management**: Clear task lists with completion tracking
- 🎯 **Sequential Execution**: AI completes tasks in order, maintaining focus and context
- 🔒 **Approval Gates**: Each phase requires your confirmation before proceeding

## What is Spec Workflow MCP?

Spec Workflow MCP helps development teams maintain high-quality project documentation by providing an AI-powered workflow that guides you through creating comprehensive specifications.

### ❌ Without Spec Workflow MCP

- Inconsistent documentation across projects
- Missing critical requirements details  
- Unstructured design decisions
- Unclear implementation tasks
- Manual tracking of document completion
- **AI jumps between tasks randomly without structure**
- **No connection between requirements and actual code implementation**

### ✅ With Spec Workflow MCP

- Standardized document templates for requirements, design, and tasks
- AI-guided document generation based on best practices
- Automatic progress tracking and workflow management
- Smart validation of document completeness
- Seamless integration with Claude and other MCP-compatible tools
- **AI follows task order systematically, completing one before moving to the next**
- **Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow ensures code aligns with business needs**

## Workflow Stages

1. **Requirements Gathering** → 2. **System Design** → 3. **Implementation Planning**

Each stage has:
- Structured templates
- Validation rules
- AI-powered content generation
- Progress tracking

## Development

### Build from Source

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Debug with MCP Inspector
